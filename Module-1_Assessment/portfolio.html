        <p class="otherFont"> Hello! My name is Luke Gerhard and I am aspiring to be a software developer.
          I first became interested in learning to code in high school during my sophomore year.
          I had a math teacher that was going to be teaching an AP Computer Science class and 
          he was one of my favorite math teachers, so I signed up for the class the next year.
          I enjoyed learning about how computers work at a simple level, and even though it is 
          not important to be able to code effectively, learning about binary number systems 
          and hexadecimal number systems fascinated me at the time. I remember finding an 
          online “binary translator” that would translate simpel text into strings of hundreds 
          of 0’s and 1’s. I would copy and paste these strings of binary into messages to send 
          to my friends over facebook as some sort of secret code, even though all it did is add 
          extra steps to our communication. </p>

          My earliest experience coding was in Java during my junior year in 2011, and the 
          next computer science class I took was a C++ class in college. Even though I had 
          fun and enjoyed both classes, I ended up not pursuing it as a career. Instead I 
          became a Math teacher. I quite enjoy math, and I enjoy teaching so I thought it 
          would be a good fit for me. However, although I have enjoyed some aspects of being 
          a math teacher, I have recently decided it is time for me to move on to do something 
          else. As I was making the decision to look at changing careers, I remembered how much 
          I enjoyed my computer science classes and thought maybe it was time to revisit the idea 
          of coding as a profession. Having now decided to pursue a career in software 
          development, I am excited for what the future may hold!
