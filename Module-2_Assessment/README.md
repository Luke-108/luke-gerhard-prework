README

Hello!
My name is Luke and I am the main contributer to this project.
The purpose of this project is for me to learn how to use GitHub as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to create simple websites and games.
I plan on using this as a reference for myself to look at what I learend if I need to freshen up on any of the skills i've learned while working on this project.

This project might be useful to you if you want to see a simple exicution of small HTML/CSS/JS tasks and, in particular, one game of Hangman. 

Thanks for looking in,
bye!
